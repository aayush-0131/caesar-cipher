#  caesar-cipher üîê

A simple, command-line tool for encrypting and decrypting messages using the Caesar cipher. This project is written in Python and has zero external dependencies, making it perfect for offline use.

## What is a Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It's a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' would be replaced by 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so on.

## Features

- Encrypt messages with a given shift key.
- Decrypt messages with the same shift key.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Preserves spaces, numbers, and punctuation.
- Runs entirely offline.

## How to Use

1.  Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal:
    ```bash
    cd caesar-cipher
    ```
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python cipher.py
    ```
4.  Follow the on-screen prompts to either encrypt, decrypt, or quit the application.
